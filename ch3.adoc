This chapter introduces some of the fundamental objects and features of
kubernetes.

== Labels

Imagine you have a POD that’s need to be host on a machine with certain
specifications ( SSD HD, physical location , processing power , ..,etc ) 
OR imagine you want to search or group your PODs for easier administration 
what would you do ?
then label is your way to go, in Kubernetes Label is a Key/value pairs attached to an object  
let’s see how can we use label to make a POD is lunched on a certain machine

[NOTE]
====
* In kubernetes, any objects can be identified using a label.
* You can assign multiple labels per object but avoid using too much label or
  too little, too much would get you confused and too little won’t give the real
  benefits of grouping, selecting and searching. 
* Best practice is to assign labels to indicate
    - application/program ID use this POD
    - owner (who manage this POD/application)
    - stage (the POD/application in development/testing/ production as well version)
    - resource requirements (SSD, CPU, storage)
    - location (preferred location/zone/ Datacenter to run this POD/application) 
====

Let’s assign label (stage: testing) & (zone: production) to two nodes
respectively then try to lunch a POD in a node which has the label (stage: testing) 
 
----
kubectl get nodes --show-labels

NAME      STATUS     ROLES     AGE       VERSION   LABELS
cent222   Ready      <none>    2h        v1.9.2    <none>
cent111   NotReady   <none>    2h        v1.9.2    <none>
cent333   Ready      <none>    2h        v1.9.2    <none>


kubectl label nodes cent333 stage=testing
kubectl label nodes cent222 stage=production

kubectl get nodes --show-labels

NAME         STATUS    ROLES   AGE  VERSION  LABELS
cent222  Ready     <none>  2h   v1.9.2   stage=production
cent111  NotReady  <none>  2h   v1.9.2   <none>
cent333  Ready     <none>  2h   v1.9.2   stage=testing
----

now let’s lunch a basic Nginx POD tagged with stage=testing in the nodeSelector
and confirm it will land on a node tagged with stage=testing. kube-scheduler uses
labels mentioned in the nodeSelector section of the pod yaml to select the node to
launch the pod.

[NOTE]
====
kube-scheduler picks the node based on various factors like individual and collective
resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity
specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference and deadlines.
====

----
[root@cent111]# cat > web-server.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: webserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    stage: testing

[root@cent111]# kubectl create -f web-server.yaml
pod "wordpress" created

[root@cent111]# kubectl get pods --output=wide
NAME        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP              NODE
wordpress   1/1       Running   0          48s       10.47.255.238   cent333
----


NOTE: You can assign POD to certain node without label by adding the argument
nodeName: nodeX under spec in the YAML file where nodeX is the name of the node  

== NameSpace

=== what is NameSpace

As in many other platforms, normally there is more than one users (or teams) working on a
kubernetes cluster. suppose a pod named 'webserver1' has been built by 'dev'
department, when 'sales' department attempts to launch a pod with the same name,
the system will give an error:

----
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "webserver1.yaml": pods "webserver1" already exists
----

Kubernetes won't allow the same object name for the kubernetes resources appear
more than once in the same scope.

'Namespaces' (or 'NS' for short) provides the scopes for the kubernetes resources
like project/tenant in openstack. Names of resources need to be unique within a
namespace, but not across namespaces. it is a nature way to divide cluster resources
between multiple users.

Kubernetes starts with three initial namespaces:

* default: The default namespace for objects with no other namespace.
* kube-system: The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system.
* kube-public: initially created by `kubeadm` tool when deploying a cluster. by
convention the purpose of this NS is to make some resources readable by all
users without authentication. it exists mostly in kubernetes clusters
bootstapped with `kubeadm` tool only.

=== create a NS

creating a NS is pretty simple. just kubectl command does the magic. you dont
need to have a yaml file.

    root@test3:~# kubectl create ns dev
    namespace/dev created
    
////
to create a NS is pretty simple, you can avoid the need to give a yaml file by
using kubectl with '-f' option, followed by '-' and hit enter:

    root@test3:~# kubectl create -f -

now the kubectl will wait for you to manually input the definition of NS from
'stdin', you can now input these 4 lines to create a VN:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
        name: dev

when done, press ctr-d to submit the stdin buffer content into kubectl.
////


new namespace dev is now created

    root@test3:~# kubectl get ns
    NAME          STATUS    AGE
    default       Active    15d
    dev           Active    5s  #<-----
    
now `webserver1` pod in `dev` NS won't conflict with `webserver1` pod in `sales`
NS.

----
$ kubectl get pod --all-namespaces -o wide
NAMESPACE  NAME        READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE   IP             NODE     NOMINATED  NODE
dev        webserver1  1/1    Running  4         2d4h  10.47.255.249  cent222  <none>
sales      webserver1  1/1    Running  4         2d4h  10.47.255.244  cent222  <none>
----

=== quota

similiar to openstack 'tenant', you can now apply constraints that limits
resource consumption per namespace. for example, you can limit the quantity of
objects that can be created in a namespace, total amount of compute resources
that may be consumed by resources, etc. the constraint in k8s is called 'quota'.
here is an example:

    kubectl -n dev create quota quota-onepod --hard pods=1

we just created a quota 'quota-onepod', and the constraint we gave is 'pods=1' - only
one pod is allowed to be created in this NS.

----
$ kubectl get quota -n dev
NAME            CREATED AT
quota-onepod    2019-06-14T04:25:37Z

$ kubectl get quota -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: 2019-06-14T04:25:37Z
    name: foobar
    namespace: quota-onepod
    resourceVersion: "823606"
    selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/dev/resourcequotas/quota-onepod
    uid: 76052368-8e5c-11e9-87fb-0050569e6cfc
  spec:
    hard:
      pods: "1"
  status:
    hard:
      pods: "1"
    used:
      pods: "1"
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
  selfLink: ""
----

now create a pod in it:

----
$ kubectl create -f pod-nginx.yaml -n dev
pod/nginx created
----

it works fine. now create a second pod in it:

----
$ kubectl create -f pod-2containers.yaml -n dev
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "pod/pod-2containers.yaml": pods "pod-1" is forbidden: exceeded quota: quota-onepod, requested: pods=1, used: pods=1, limited: pods=1
----

immediately we run into an error saying "exceeded quota".

this new pod will be created after the quota is removed:

----
$ kubectl delete quota quota-onepod -n dev
resourcequota "quota-onepod" deleted
$ kubectl create -f pod/pod-2containers.yaml -n dev
pod/pod-1 created
----

////
//RC (not introduced yet) examples:
now create a rc with replica=2

----
$ cat rc-ubuntu.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:

rc-ubuntuapp-2j84g   1/1     Running   0          10s
----

what we "desired" is 2 pods, but only 1 is "ready"

----
$ kubectl get rc
NAME        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE

the reason is that the 2nd pod creation is "forbidden" due to quota
exceeded:

== Replication Controller

you have learned how to launch a pod that representing your containers from its
yaml file in chapter 2. one question will rise in your mind: what if I need 3
exactly the same pods (each runs a apache container) to make sure the web
service appears more robust? shall I change the name in yaml file then repeat the
same commands to create required pods? or maybe with a shell script? kubernetes
already has the objects to address this exact demand and the right answer are RC -
replication controller or RS - ReplicaSet

> A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are
> running at any one time. In other words, a ReplicationController makes sure
> that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.

=== create RC

let's look at how it works with an example. first create a yaml file for a RC
object named `myweb`.

    #myweb-rc.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: myweb
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        app: myweb
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: myweb
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: myweb
            image: kubeguide/tomcat-app:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

again, `kind` indicates the object type that this yaml file is to define, here
it is a RC instead of a pod. in `metadata` it is showing the RC's `name` as
`myweb`.  in `spec` is the detail specification of this RC object. `replicas` 3
indicates a same pod will be cloned to make sure the total number of
pods created by the RC is always 3. `template` gives information about
the containers that will run in the pod, same as what you saw in a `pod` yaml
file.

now use this yaml file to create the RC object:

    kubectl create -f myweb-rc.yaml
    replicationcontroller "myweb" created

if you are quick enough, you may capture the intermediate status when the new
pods are being created:

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5ggv6   1/1       Running             0          9s
    myweb-lbj89   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          9s
    myweb-m6nrx   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          9s
   

eventually you will see 3 pods launched:

    $ kubectl get rc
    NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
    myweb           3         3         3       3m29s

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5ggv6   1/1       Running   0          21m
    myweb-lbj89   1/1       Running   0          21m
    myweb-m6nrx   1/1       Running   0          21m
 
with `replicas` parameter specified in RC object yaml file, the kubernetes
`replication controller`, running as part of `kube-controller-manager` process in
the `master node`, will keep monitoring the number of running pods spawned by
the RC, and automatically launch new ones should any of them runs into failures. 
the key to learn is, individual pod may die any time, but the "pool" as a whole
is always up and running, making a robust service. you will understand this
better when you learn kubernetes `service`.

=== test RC

you can test rc's impact by deleting one of the pod:

    $ kubectl delete pod myweb-5ggv6
    pod "myweb-5ggv6" deleted

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5ggv6   0/1       Terminating   0          22m        #<---
    myweb-5v9w6   1/1       Running       0          2s
    myweb-lbj89   1/1       Running       0          22m
    myweb-m6nrx   1/1       Running       0          22m

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5v9w6   1/1       Running       0          5s
    myweb-lbj89   1/1       Running       0          22m
    myweb-m6nrx   1/1       Running       0          22m

you can scale up/down replicas in rc.

    $ kubectl scale rc myweb --replica=5
    replicationcontroller/myweb scaled
    
    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5v9w6   1/1       Running             0          8s
    myweb-lbj89   1/1       Running             0          22m
    myweb-m6nrx   1/1       Running             0          22m
    myweb-hnnlj   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          2s
    myweb-kbgwm   1/1       ContainerCreating   0          2s
    
    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME          READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-5v9w6   1/1       Running       0          10s
    myweb-lbj89   1/1       Running       0          22m
    myweb-m6nrx   1/1       Running       0          22m
    myweb-hnnlj   1/1       Running       0          5s
    myweb-kbgwm   1/1       Running       0          5s

there are other benefits with RC. actually since this abstraction is so popular
and heavily used in practice that, two very similar objects `RS` - `ReplicaSet`
and `Deploy` - `Deployment` have been designed with more powerful features
introduced.  roughly, you can call them "next generation of RC". let's stop
exploring more RC features for now and move our focus to these 2 objects.

== ReplicaSet

`ReplicaSet`, or `RS` object, is pretty much the same thing as a `RC` object,
with just one major exception - the looks of `selector`.

    $ cat myweb-rs.yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: ReplicaSet
    metadata:
      name: myweb
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:                                    #<---
          app: myweb                                    #<---
        matchExpressions:                               #<---
          - {key: app, operator: In, values: [myweb]}   #<---
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: myweb
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: myweb
            image: kubeguide/tomcat-app:v1
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
            env:
            - name: MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST
              value: 'mysql'
            - name: MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT
              value: '3306'
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: "123456"

RC uses "Equality-based" selector while RS uses "set-based". function-wise the
two forms of selector do the same job - to "select" the pod with a matching
"label".

    #RS:
    selector:
      matchLabels:                                 
        app: myweb                                 
      matchExpressions:                            
        - {key: app, operator: In, values: [myweb]}

    #RC:
    selector:
      app: myweb

    $ kubectl create -f myweb-rs.yaml
    replicaset.extensions/myweb created

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-lkwvt                  1/1     Running   0          8s

a RS is created and it launchs a pod, just same as what a RC would do.
if you compare the `kubectl describe` on the 2 objects:

    $ kubectl describe rs myweb                                        
    ......
    Selector:     app=myweb,app in (myweb)                             
    ......
      Type    Reason            Age   From                   Message   
      ----    ------            ----  ----                   -------   
      Normal  SuccessfulCreate  15s   replicaset-controller  Created pod: myweb-kt9zx

    $ kubectl describe rc myweb
    ......
    Selector:     app=myweb
    ......
      Type    Reason            Age   From                    Message
      ----    ------            ----  ----                    -------
      Normal  SuccessfulCreate  19s   replication-controller  Created pod: myweb-tbbhc

as you see, most part of the output are the same, with only exception of
selector format. you can also scale the RS same way as you do with RC:

    $ kubectl scale rs myweb --replicas=5
    replicaset.extensions/myweb scaled

    $ kubectl get pod
    NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    myweb-4jvvx                  1/1     Running   0          3m30s
    myweb-722pf                  1/1     Running   0          3m30s
    myweb-8z8f8                  1/1     Running   0          3m30s
    myweb-lkwvt                  1/1     Running   0          4m28s
    myweb-ww9tn                  1/1     Running   0          3m30s

== Deployment 

now you may start to wonder why kubernetes has two different objects to do the
almost same job. as mentioned earlier the features of RC has been extended
through the 2 new objects. we've seen the first new object `RS` , which has done
the same job of `RC` only with a different selector format, now we'll check out
the other new object `DEPLOY - deployment` and explore the features coming from it.

=== create a deployment

simply changing `kind` attribute from `ReplicaSet` to `deployment` we get the
yaml file of a deployment object:

    $ cat myweb-deployment.yaml
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
    kind: Deployment    #<---
    metadata:
      name: myweb
    ...(everything else remains the same as replicaset)...

    $ kubectl create -f myweb-deployment.yaml
    deployment.extensions/myweb created

    $ kubectl get deployment
    NAME                   DESIRED  CURRENT  UP-TO-DATE  AVAILABLE  AGE
    deployment.apps/myweb  1        1        1           1          21s

the deployment is a relatively higher level of abstraction than RC and RS.
deployment does not create a pod directly, the `describe` command reveals this:

    $ kubectl describe deployments myweb
    Name:                   myweb
    Namespace:              default
    CreationTimestamp:      Sat, 25 May 2019 16:00:26 -0400

    RollingUpdateStrategy:  1 max unavailable, 1 max surge

    OldReplicaSets:  <none>
    NewReplicaSet:   myweb-c586fd645 (1/1 replicas created)     #<---
    Events:          <none>

=== deployment work flow

what happens is when you create a Deployment, a replica set is created
automatically. The pods defined in a Deployment object are created and supervised
by the Deployment's replicaset. RC on the other hand, works with pod directly.
the workflows differences are shown in this diagram:

                             |=> pod
                             |
    RC =============>========|=> pod
                             |
                             |=> pod

                             |=> pod
                             |
    deployment =====> RS ====|=> pod
                             |
                             |=> pod

You might still be wondering why you need RS as one more layer sitting in
between deployment and pod, after all with RC's magic it seems sufficient to
keep a set of pods running.

=== rolling update

the reason is about another important usage scenario in pratice: pod update.
"rolling update" feature is one of the "more powerful feature" coming with
deployment object. in this section we'll demonstrate the feature with a test
case, then we'll explain how it works.

==== test rolling update

suppose we have a nginx-deployment, with `replica=3` an pod image `1.7.9`.
later we want to upgrade the image from version `1.7.9` to new image version
`1.9.1`. with `kuberctl` we can use `set image` option and specify the new
version number to trigger the update:

    $ kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1
    deployment.extensions/nginx-deployment image updated

now chck the deployment information again:

    $ kubectl describe deployment/nginx-deployment
    Name:                   nginx-deployment
    Namespace:              default
    CreationTimestamp:      Tue, 11 Sep 2018 20:49:45 -0400
    Labels:                 app=nginx
    Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision=2
    Selector:               app=nginx
    Replicas:               3 desired | 1 updated | 4 total | 3 available | 1 unavailable
    StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
    MinReadySeconds:        0
    RollingUpdateStrategy:  25% max unavailable, 25% max surge
    Pod Template:
      Labels:  app=nginx
      Containers:
       nginx:
        Image:        nginx:1.9.1       #<------
        Port:         80/TCP
        Host Port:    0/TCP
        Environment:  <none>
        Mounts:       <none>
      Volumes:        <none>
    Conditions:
      Type           Status  Reason
      ----           ------  ------
      Available      True    MinimumReplicasAvailable
      Progressing    True    ReplicaSetUpdated
    OldReplicaSets:  nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6 (3/3 replicas created)
    NewReplicaSet:   nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db (1/1 replicas created)
    Events:
      Type    Reason             Age   From                   Message
      ----    ------             ----  ----                   -------
      Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m    deployment-controller  Scaled up replica
      set nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6 to 3  #<---
      Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  7s    deployment-controller  Scaled up replica
      set nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db to 1  #<---

two changes we can observe here:

* image version in deployment is updated
* a new RS `nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db` is created, with a `replica` set to 1

and with the new RS with `replica` being 1, a new pod ("the fourth one") is now generated

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    frontend-6cfdb4d686-2fvvm           1/1       Running             3          3d
    mysql-z8k42                         1/1       Running             2          3d
    myweb-csbvj                         1/1       Running             3          3d
    myweb-s9tx8                         1/1       Running             3          3d
    nginx                               1/1       Running             0          9h
    nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6-88wqk   1/1       Running             0          4m
    nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6-m4fbj   1/1       Running             0          4m
    nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6-td2xn   1/1       Running             0          4m
    nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db-4b8z7   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          17s        #<------
    redis-php                           2/2       Running             4          2d
    volume-pod                          2/2       Running             4          2d

the new pod is with new image:

    $ kubectl describe pod/nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db-4b8z7 | grep Image:
    ...(snipped)...
        Image:          nginx:1.9.1     #<---
    ...(snipped)...

while the old pod is still with old image

    $ kubectl describe pod/nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6-td2xn | grep Image:
    ...(snipped)...
        Image:          nginx:1.7.9     #<------
    ...(snipped)...

wait and keep checking the pods status, eventually all old pods are terminated
and 3 new pods are running - the pod name confirms they are new ones:

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db-4b8z7   1/1       Running   0          1m
    nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db-bsw25   1/1       Running   0          18s
    nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db-n9tpg   1/1       Running   0          21s

so the "update" is done and all pods are now running with new version of the
image. 

==== how it works

after you see our update process, you may argue that: hold on... this is now
"update", this should be called "replacement" - kubernetes use 3 new pods
running with new image to replace the old pods! precisely speaking, yes that is
true. but that is how it works kubernetes's "philosophy" - pod is cheap and
replacement is easier. imaging how much work it will be when you have to "login"
each pod, uninstall old images, cleaning up the environment and only to install
a new image. let's look at more details about this process and understand why it
is called a "rolling" update.

when you update the pod with new software, the `deployment` object introduces a
new RS that will start the pod update process. the idea is NOT to "login" to the
existing pod and do the image update in there, instead, the new RC just creates
a new pod equiped with the new software release in it. once this new (and
"additional") pod is up and running, the original RS will be "scaled down" by
one, making the total number of running pod remaining unchanged. new RS will
continue to scale up by one and original RS scales down by same number.  this
process repeats until number of pods created by new RS reaches the original
replica number defined in the deployment, and that is the time when all of the
original RS's pods are terminated. this process is depicted in this diagram:

                  
                 |           |=> pod-v1
    deployment ==|==> RS ====|=> pod-v1
                 |   (v1)    |=> pod-v1

                 |           |=> pod-v1
                 |==> RS ====|=> pod-v1
                 |   (v1)    |
    deployment ==|
                 |           |=> pod-v2
                 |==> RS ====|
                 |   (v2)    |


                 |           |=> pod-v1
                 |==> RS ====|
                 |   (v1)    |
    deployment ==|
                 |           |=> pod-v2
                 |==> RS ====|=> pod-v2
                 |   (v2)    |

                 |           |
                 |==> RS ====|
                 |   (v1)    |
    deployment ==|
                 |           |=> pod-v2
                 |==> RS ====|=> pod-v2
                 |   (v2)    |=> pod-v2


                 |           |=> pod-v2
    deployment ==|==> RS ====|=> pod-v2
                 |   (v2)    |=> pod-v2
                  
now coming back to the question that why deployment is invented given that RC is
already designed and works fine. This whole process of creating a new RS,
scaling up the new RS and scaling down the old one simultaneously, is fully
automated and taken care of by the deployment object. it is `deployment` who is
`deploying` and driving `ReplicaSet` object, which, in this sense working as
merely a backend of it. 

this is why `deployment` is considered a higher layer object in kubernetes, also
the reason why it is officially recommended to never use `ReplicaSet` along
without `deployment`. in contrast, RC alone, without this additional higher
layer abstraction, is not able to coordinate this process.

==== record

deployment also has the ability to "record" the whole process, so in case
needed, you can review the update history after the update job is done:

----
$ kubectl describe deployment/nginx-deployment
Name:                   nginx-deployment
...(snipped)...
NewReplicaSet:   nginx-deployment-6fdbb596db (3/3 replicas created)

  ----    ------             ----  ----                   -------

  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  23m   deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set nginx-deployment-67594d6bf6 to 0  #<------
----

==== pause/resume/undo

additionally, you can also pause/resume the update process to verify the changes
before proceeding:

    $ kubectl rollout pause deployment/nginx-deployment
    $ kubectl rollout resume deployment/nginx-deployment

you can even "undo" the update when things are going wrong during the
maintenance window

    $ kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment

----
$ kubectl describe deployment/nginx-deployment

----

This is pretty much similar as the junos's `rollback` magic command that you
probably use everyday when you need to quickly revert the changes you make to
your router. Typically you do this when something is broken in your router
deployment. comparing with how much work it takes to prepare for the software
upgrade during maintenance window in the old days, this is going to be a killing
feature to have! later throughout this book we may still use pod/RC to
demonstrate different usage case with labs, however, keep in mind that RC is
going to be deprecated, and it is rather unlikely that you will ever need to
create Pods directly in production environment, so deployment is the
future.   

== Service

POD gets instantiated, terminated and moved from one Node to another, in doing
so POD changes IP address so how would we keep track of that to get uninteruppted
functonalites from pod?  Even if the POD isn’t moving, how traffic reach group of PODs
via single entity?

the answer for both questions is Kubernetes 'SVC - services'.  

Services is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by
which you can access them, you may think of Services as your waiter in a big
restaurant, this waiter isn’t cooking nor preparing the food but he just
abstract everything happing at the kitchen for you as you deal only with this
waiter.

Simply Service is a layer 4 loadbalancer exposes pods functionalities via specific
ip and port. The service and pods are linked via labels like RS. 

so let’s understand different type of services:

* ClusterIP
* NodePort
* LoadBalancer

=== ClusterIP service

the `ClusterIP` type of service is the simplest one. it is the default mode if
the `ServiceType` is not given. the kubernetes official website gives this
diagram to illustrate how clusterIP service works:

image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/60740886-56cefe80-9f35-11e9-8b16-a61108660d6e.png[]

ClusterIP service is exposed on a `clusterIP` and a service port. when client
pods need to access the service it sends request toward this `clusterIP` and
service port. This model works great if all requests are coming from inside
of the same cluster. The nature of the ClusterIP limits the scope of this service
to be only within the cluster. overall by default the ClusterIP is not reachable
from external. 

==== create clusterIP service

let's create our first service in contrail environment, with service type
`clusterIP`. 

----
$ cat service-web-clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-web-clusterip
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webserver
----

the yaml file looks pretty simple and self-explanatory. it defined a service
`service-web-clusterip` with the "service port" `8888`, mapping to `targetPort`
which means "container port" `80` in some pod. the `selector` indicates that
whichever pod with a label `app: webserver` will be choosen to be the backend
pod responding service request. 

now generate the service object by `apply` the yaml file:

----
$ kubectl apply -f service-web-clusterip.yaml
service/service-web-clusterip created
----

following kubectl commands are commonly used to quickly verify the service 
and backend pod objects.

----
$ kubectl get svc -o wide
NAME                   TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP  PORT(S)   AGE    SELECTOR
service-web-clusterip  ClusterIP  10.101.150.135  <none>       8888/TCP  9m10s  app=webserver

$ kubectl get pod -o wide -l 'app=webserver'
No resources found.
----

the service is created successfully, there is no doubt about it. but there is no
pods for the service. the reason is there is no pod with the label matching to the
`selector` in the service. now we just need to create the pod with a proper
label.

we can define a pod directly, but given the benefits of RC and deployment over
pod as we've introduced earlier, use RC or deployment is more pratical. later on
you will understand this is the right choice. in our example we define a RC
object named `rc-webserver`.

----
$ cat rc-webserver.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: rc-webserver
  labels:
    app: webserver
spec:
  replicas: 1           #<---
  selector:
    app: webserver
  template:
    metadata:
      name: webserver
      labels:
        app: webserver  #<---
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webserver
        image: savvythru/contrail-frontend-app
        securityContext:
           privileged: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----

the RC `rc-webserver` has a label `app: webserver`, matching the SELECTOR in
defined in our service. `replicas: 1` instruct RC controller to launch only 1
pod at the moment.

----
$ kubectl apply -f rc-webserver.yaml
replicationcontroller/rc-webserver created

$ kubectl get pod -o wide -l 'app=webserver'
NAME                READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE  IP             NODE     NOMINATED  NODE
rc-webserver-vl6zs  1/1    Running  0         24s  10.47.255.238  cent333  <none>
----

immediately the pod is choosen to be the backend. 
here are some brief summaries about the output:

* the service got a "ClusterIP" or "service IP" of `10.106.176.17` allocated
  from the service IP pool. 
* service port is `8888` as what is defined in yaml. 
* by default the protocol type is `TCP` if not declared in yaml file. you can
  use `protocol: UDP` to declare a UDP service.
* the backend pod can be located with the label selector

TIP: the example shown use a "equality-based" selector (`-l`) to locate the
backend pod, you can also use a "set-based" syntax to archive the same effect.
for example: `kubectl get pod -o wide -l 'app in (webserver)'`

==== verify cluserIP service

Now to verify if the service actually works, let's start another pod as a client
to initiate a http request toward the service. for this test we'll login to a
`cirros` pod and use `curl` command to send a http request toward the service.
you'll see the cirros pod being used as a client to send request throughout of
this book.

----
$ kubectl exec -it cirros -- curl 10.101.150.135:8888
<html>
<style>
  h1   {color:green}
  h2   {color:red}
</style>
  <div align="center">
  <head>
    <title>Contrail Pod</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1><br><h2>This page is served by a <b>Contrail</b>
    pod</h2><br><h3>IP address = 10.47.255.238<br>Hostname =
    rc-webserver-vl6zs</h3>
    <img src="/static/giphy.gif">
  </body>
  </div>
</html>
----

the http request toward the service reaches a backend pod running the web server
application, which responds with a HTML page.

to better demonstrate which pod is providing the service, we are running a
customized pod image that runs a simple web server. the web server is configured
in such a way that whenever receiving a request, it will return a simple HTML
page with local pod IP and hostname embeded. This way the curl returns something
more meaningful in our test. 

the returned HTML looks relatively "OK" to read, but there is a way to make it
more "eye-friendly":

----
$ kubectl exec -it cirros -- curl 10.101.150.135:8888 | w3m -T text/html | head
                                     Hello
                     This page is served by a Contrail pod
                          IP address = 10.47.255.238
                         Hostname = rc-webserver-vl6zs
----

the `w3m` tool is a "lightweight" console based web browser installed in the
host. with `w3m` we can render a html webpage into text, which is more readable
than the HTML page.

now we are convinced our service works. requests to service has been
redirected to the correct backend pod, with a pod IP `10.47.255.238`, pod name
`rc-webserver-vl6zs`.

==== specify a clusterIP

if you want to have a specific 'clusterIP', you can mention it in the spec.
Ip address should be in service ip pool.

Sample yaml with specific 'clusterIP'

----
$ cat service-web-clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-web-clusterip
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.101.150.150 #<---
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webserver
----


=== NodePort service

NodePort service exposes a service on each node's ip at a static port. It maps
a static port on each node with a port of the application the POD as shown in 
the diagram 
 
image::https://github.com/pinggit/kubernetes-contrail-day-one/blob/master/diagrams/node%20port%20chapter%203.png[]
there is 2 very important parts in this services YAML file ports and selector.

targetPort is the actual port used by the application in here its port 80 as we
are planning to run a web server and nodeport is port on each node. 

selector is the label selector which determine which set of pods targeted by
this services, in here any POD with label app: FRONT-END will be serviced by
this services

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: web-app
    spec:
      selector:
        app: webserver
      type: NodePort
      ports:
      - targetPort: 80
        port: 80
        nodePort: 32001 #<--- (optional)

[NOTE]
====
* Kubernetes by default allocate node port from (30000-32767) range if it is not
  mentioned in the spec and the specified port should be in the configured range.
  it could be changed using the flag --service-node-port-range.
* The default service type is ClusterIP 
* Be aware with the change of the Node ip address as it could effect your services 
====

now let’s expose a nginx pod with the services shown above

    [root@cent11]# cat nginx.yaml 
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: nginx-pod
          labels:
            app: webserver
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: nginx-c
              image: nginx

    [root@cent11]# kubectl create -f web-app.yaml
    service "web-app" created

    [root@cent11]# kubectl describe service web-app
    Name:                     web-app
    Namespace:                default
    Labels:                   <none>
    Annotations:              <none>
    Selector:                 app=webserver
    Type:                     NodePort
    IP:                       10.98.108.168
    Port:                     <unset>  80/TCP
    TargetPort:               80/TCP
    NodePort:                 <unset>  32001/TCP
    Endpoints:                10.47.255.252:80
    Session Affinity:         None
    External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
    Events:                   <none>

Now we can test that by send CURL -i which is a http request using the CLI toward the (any)node IP address

    [root@cent11 ~]# kubectl get pod -o wide
    
    NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP              NODE      NOMINATED NODE
    nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          20m   10.47.255.252   cent222   <none>

    [root@cent11 ~]# kubectl describe node cent22 | grep InternalIP
  InternalIP:  10.85.188.17

    [root@cent11 ]#curl 10.85.188.17:32001

=== loadbalancer service

essentially, a loadBalancer service goes one more step beyond what the NodePort
service does. it exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider’s
loadbalancer. loadbalancer by its nature automatically includes all features and
functions of NodePort and ClusterIP Services. 

//the external load balancer routes the traffic 

Kubernetes clusters running on cloud providers support the automatic provision
of a load balancer. the only difference between the 3 type of services are the
`type` value. to reuse the same NodePort service yaml file and create a
loadbalancer service, just set the `type` to `LoadBalancer`:

----
$ cat service-web-lb.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-web-lb
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webserver
  type: LoadBalancer    #<---
----

the cloud will see this keyword and a load balancer will be created, with a
public IP allocated serving as the frontend virtual IP. traffic coming to this
external IP will be redirected to the service backend pod. please keep in mind
that this "redirection" process, is solely an transport layer operation.
frontend public external IP and port will be translated to private backend
cluster IP. it does not involve any application layer activities. there is no
such things like parsing URL, proxy HTTP request, etc. because the loadbalancer
VIP is publicly reachable, any Internet host whoever has access to the VIP and
port can access the service provided by kubernetes cluster.

from Internet host's perspective, when it requests service, it refers this
public external VIP and service port and the request will reaches the backend
pod.  the external VIP is acting as a "gateway" between service inside of the cluster
and outside world.

how is a loadbalancer implemented in loadbalancer service is "vendor-specific".
a GCE loadbalancer may work in a totally different way with a AWS loadbalancer.
we'll have a detail demonstration about how loadbalancer service works in
contrail kubernetes environment in chapter 4.

==== externalIP

Exposing service outside of the cluster can also be achieved via `externalIPs`
option. 

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-web-externalips
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webserver
  externalIPs:          #<---
  - 101.101.101.1       #<---
----

In the Service spec, `externalIPs` can be specified along with any of
the ServiceTypes. `externalIPs` are not managed by Kubernetes and are the
responsibility of the cluster administrator. 


=== service implementation: kube-proxy

By default kubernetes uses kube-proxy for services. kube-proxy can be deployed in
user-space proxy-mode, iptables proxy-mode and ipvs. when the traffic hits the node,
it would be forwarded to one of the back end pod via a depolyed kube-proxy forwarding
plane. CNI providers can have there own implementations for services.


== Endpoints

in our 'service' introduction, there is one object that is involved but we
haven't explored is 'EP - endpoint'. we've learned it is through label selector
that a particular pod or group of pods with matching labels are choosen to be
the backend, so that the service request traffic will be redirected to them.
The IP and port information of the "matching" pods are maintained in the 'endpoint'
object.  The pods may die and spawn anytime, the "mortal" nature of the pod will
most possibly make the new pods be respawned with new IP address. during this dynamic
process the 'endpoints' will always be updated accordingly to reflect the current
backend pod IPs, so the service traffic redirection will act properly. 

here is an example to demonstrate some quick steps to verify the service,
corresponding endpoint and the pod with matching labels

create a service:

----
$ cat svc/service-web-clusterip.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service-web-clusterip
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 8888
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: webserver
----

list the endpoint:

----
$ kubectl get ep
NAME             ENDPOINTS          AGE
service-web-lb   10.47.255.252:80   5d17h
----

locate pod with the label that is used by selector in service:

----
$ kubectl get pod -o wide -l 'app=webserver'
NAME                READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE    IP             NODE     NOMINATED NODE LABELS
rc-webserver-rjlgr  1/1    Running  4         5d17h  10.47.255.252  cent333  <none>         app=webserver
----

scale the backend pods

----
$ kubectl scale rc webserver --replicas=3
----

----
$ kubectl get pod -o wide -l 'app=webserver'
NAME                READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE    IP             NODE     NOMINATED NODE LABELS
rc-webserver-rjlgr  1/1    Running  4         5d17h  10.47.255.252  cent333  <none>         app=webserver
rc-webserver-45skv  1/1    Running  0         5s     10.47.255.251  cent222  <none>         app=webserver
rc-webserver-m2cp5  1/1    Running  0         5s     10.47.255.250  cent111  <none>         app=webserver
----

----
$ kubectl get ep
NAME             ENDPOINTS                                            AGE
service-web-lb   10.47.255.250:80,10.47.255.251:80,10.47.255.252:80   5d17h
----

.Service without SELECTOR

in the preceding example, the `Endpoints` object is generated automatically by
the kubernetes system whenever a service is created, and at least one pod with
matching label exists. Another use case of endpoint, is for a service that has
no label selector defined. in that case you can manually map the service to the
network address and port where it's running, by adding an endpoint object
manually and you can connect the endpoint with the service. this can be very
useful in some scenarios. for example, in your setup you have a backend web
server running in a physical server, you still want to integrate it into a
kubernetes `Service`.  you just create the service as usual, and then create an
endpoint with an "address" and "port" pointing to the web server. that's it! the
`Service` does not care about the backend type, it just redirect the service
request traffic exactly the same way as if all backend is pod.

== Ingress 

You’ve now seen ways of exposing a service to clients outside the cluster:
`NodePort` service and `LoadBalancer service`. another method is `Ingress`

=== kubernetes Ingress introduction

in service section, we understand that `service` works in transport layter so
sees only IP and ports.  in reality, however, the "raw" IP is rarely used today
- typically you access all services via URLs. In the background there is
"mapping" or "resolution" from URL to IP and that is normally when DNS comes
into picture.  when user input a URL to access a service, DNS resolves the
`host` in it to an IP address which `service` can accept and process. 

TIP: in practice, to ensures the availability, uptime and performance, a public
domain name is typically bound to a group of public IP addresses and load
sharing happens between them.  that is why DNS sometimes is also used to do
loadbalancing.

kubernetes Ingress, works in a similar-looking but essentially different way
than DNS. `Ingress`, or `ing` for short, is another "core" concept of
Kubernetes. it allows simple, rule-based HTTP routing that does not exist in
service. Ingress is built on top of service. with Ingress, you can define
URL-based rules to distribute HTTP/HTTPS access requests to multiple different
"backend services".  we've learned a lot about kubernetes `service` so far, so
you understand what will happen after that - the requests will be forwarded to
each service's corresponding backend pods.

=== Ingress vs service

there are similiarities between loadbalancer service and ingress. both can
expose service to outside of the cluster. but there are some main differences.

.operation layer/level
`Ingress` operates at the application layer of the OSI network model, while
`service` operates at transport layer only. `Ingress` understand the HTTP/HTTPS
protocol, service only does forwarding based on IP and port, which means it does
not care about the application layer protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) details.

////
Ingress provides "Layer 7" (application layer) load-balancing whereas the
`service` provide "Layer 4" (transport layer) load-balancing. 
in contrast with `service`, Ingress is aware of the HTTP/HTTPS protocols. 
////

.forwarding mode
Ingress does the application layer "proxy", in pretty much the same way a
traditional web loadbalancer does.

//the implementation uses open sourced haproxy to do the "proxy" job, which is
//typically an application layer forwarding. 
a typical web loadbalancer proxy sitting between machine A (client) and B
(server), works at the application layer. it is "aware of" the application layer
protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) so the client-server intraction does NOT look
"transparent" to the loadbalancer.  basically It creates two connections each
with source (A) and destination (B) machine.  Machine A does not even know about
the existence of machine B at all. For machine A, Proxy is the only thing it
talks to and it does not care how and where the proxy gets its data.

.number of public IPs
each service of the ingress needs an public ip if it is exposed directly to
outside of the cluster. when ingress is a front-end to all these services, one
public ip would be sufficient which makes life easy for cloud-admin.

=== Ingress object

before we talk about Ingress object, the best way to get a feel of it is to look
at the yaml definition:

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-sf
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.juniper.net
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /dev
        backend:
          serviceName: webservice-1
          servicePort: 8888
      - path: /qa
        backend:
          serviceName: webservice-2
          servicePort: 8888
----

it looks pretty simple. the `spec` defines only one item that is the `rules`.
the rules says a `host`, which is "juniper" URL here, may have 2 possible `path`
in the URL string. the `path` is whatever follows the `host` in the URL, in this
case they are `/dev` and `/qa`. each `path` is then associated to a different
service. when Ingress sees HTTP requests arrives, it proxies the traffic to each
URL path's associated backend service. each service, as we've learned this in
`service` section, will deliver the request to their corresponding backend path.
that's it. 
actually this is one of the 3 types of Ingress that kubernetes
supports today - "simple fan-out Ingress".  later we'll introduce the other two
types of Ingress.

****
.about URL, `host`, `path`
term `host` and `path` are used frequently in kubernetes Ingress documentations.
`host`:: is "fully qualified domain name" of a server. 
`path`, or `url-path`:: is the rest part of the string after the `host` in a
URL. in the case of having a `port` in the URL, then it is the strings after the
port.

let's take a look at the following URL:

    http://www.juniper.net:1234/my/resource
           --------------- ---- -----------
           host            port path

    http://www.juniper.net:/my/resource
           --------------- ------------
           host            path

`host` is `www.juniper.net`, whatever follows port `1234` is called `path`,
`my/resource` in this example. if a URL has no `port`, then the strings
following `host` are `path`. 
//one tip is that strictly speaking the `/` between
//`host` and `path` are not part of either one. 
for more details you can read
rfc1738, but for the context of this book understanding what we introduce here
would suffice.
****

if you now think kubernetes Ingress is nothing but to define some rules, and the
rules are just to instruct the system to direct incoming request to different
services, based on the URLs, you are basically right in the high level. the
figure below shows the dependency between the 3 kubernetes object: `Ingress`,
`service` and `pod`:

.Ingress
image::https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2038044/60773060-5c5f4c80-a0cd-11e9-88bb-58c239a442c4.png[]

in practice there are other things you need to understand.  in reality to handle
the ingress rules, you need at least another component called `ingress
controller`

=== ingress controller

An ingress controller is responsible for reading the Ingress rules and program
the rules into the proxy which does the real work - dispatching traffic based
on `host` / URL.

ingress controllers are tyically implemented by a third party vendors.
Different Kubernetes environments have different ingress controller based on the need
of the cluster. each ingress controllers have their own implementations to
program the ingress rules. bottom line is, there has to be an Ingress controller
running in the cluster.

ingress controller providers:

* nginx
* gce
* haproxy
* avi
* f5
* istio
* contour
* etc

You may deploy any number of ingress controllers within a cluster. When you
create an ingress, you should annotate each ingress with the appropriate
`ingress.class` to indicate which ingress controller should be used if more than
one exists within your cluster. annotation for ingress objects will be explained
in the annotation section.

=== ingress examples

there are basically 3 types of ingresses:

* Single Service Ingress
* Simple fanout Ingress
* Name based virtual hosting Ingress

we've looked at the "simple fanout Ingress". now let's also look at yaml file
example for the other two type of Ingress.

==== single service ingress

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-single-service
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: webservice
    servicePort: 80
----

this is the simplest form of ingress. the ingress will get an external IP so the
service will be exposed to the public, however, it has no `rules` defined, so it
does not parse `host` or `path` in the URLs. all requests will goes to one same
service.

==== simple fanout ingress

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-sf
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.juniper.net
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /dev
        backend:
          serviceName: webservice-1
          servicePort: 8888
      - path: /qa
        backend:
          serviceName: webservice-2
          servicePort: 8888
----

we've checked this out in the beginning of this section.  comparing with `single
service` ingress, `simple fanout` ingress is more practical. it is not only able
to expose service via a public IP, but also able to do "URL routing" or "fan
out" based on the `path`. this is a very common usage scenario when a company
wants to direct traffic to each department's dedicated servers based on the
"suffix" of URL after the domain name. 

==== virtual host ingress

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-virutal-host
spec:
  rules:
  - host: www.juniperhr.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: webservice-1
          servicePort: 80
  - host: www.junipersales.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: webservice-2
          servicePort: 80
----

`name based virtual host` is similar to simple fanout ingress in that, it is
able to do rule-based URL routing. the unique power of this type of Ingress is
that it supports routing HTTP traffic to multiple host names at the same IP
address. the example above may not be practical (unless one day the two domains
merge!) but it is good enough to showcase the idea. in the yaml file 2 "hosts"
are defined, the "juniperhr" and "junipersales" URL respectively.  even though
ingress will be allocated with one public IP only, based on the `host` in URL,
request toward that same public IP will still be routed to different backend
services - that is why it is called a "virtual hosting Ingress". we'll have a
very detail case study in chapter 4 about this example.

NOTE: it is also possible to merge a "simple fanout" Ingress and a "virtual
host" Ingress in one Ingress, in this book we won't cover this topic though.

=== multiple ingress controller

you can have multiple ingress controllers in one cluster. in that case the
cluster needs to know which one to choose.  for example, later on in chapter 4
we'll talk about contrail's built-in Ingress controller which, does not stop us
from installing another third party Ingress controller like "nginx" Ingress
controller. we will end up having 2 Ingress controllers in the same cluster with
the names are:

* `opencontrail` (default)
* `nginx`

contrail's implementation is the `default` one so you don't have to select it
explicitly. to select nginx as Ingress controller, use this annotations
`kubernetes.io/ingress.class`:

----
metadata:
  name: foo
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
----

this will make contrail's Ingress controller `opencontrail` to ignore the
Ingress configuration.

=== secret introduction

in any modern network system, user or administrator need to deal with sensitive
information, such as username/passwords/ssh keys/etc, in the platfrom. same
thing applies to the pods in kubernetes environment.  However, exposing these
information in your pod specs as cleartext may introduce security concerns and
you need a tool/method to resolve the issue - at least to avoid the cleartext
credentials as much as possible.

Kubernetes `Secrets` object is designed specifically for this purpose. it
encodes all sensitive data and expose it into pods in a "controlled way".
//enabling encapsulating secrets by specific containers or sharing them.

this is the offical definition of kubernetes secrets:

____
A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a
password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod
specification or in an image; putting it in a Secret object allows for more
control over how it is used, and reduces the risk of accidental exposure.

Users can create secrets, and the system also creates some secrets.
To use a secret, a pod needs to reference the secret. 
////
A secret can be used with a pod in two ways: 

- as files in a volume mounted on one or more of its containers, or 
- used by kubelet when pulling images for the pod.

there are different types of secrets each serving a specific usage case. there
are also many methods to create a secret and different ways to refer it in a
pod. a complete discussion of secrets is out of the scope of this book. refer to
the offical document to get all details and track all up-to-date changes. In
this section, we'll focus on a specific type of secrets called
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`. you will learn different methods to create a
secret and how to use it in your pods. in the end, we will summarize the main
benefits of kubernetes secrets object to understand how it will help to improve
the sytem security.

=== `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` secrets

////
* Opaque：base64
* kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
* kubernetes.io/service-account-token
////

.secret types:

`opaque`:
this type ofthe Secret can contain arbitrary key-value pairs, so it is treated
as "unstructured" data from kubernetes's perspective.

`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`:
use this type of secret to authenticate with a private container registry (e.g.
a juniper server) to pull your own private image.

* `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`:
when processes running in containers of a pod access the apiserver, they has to
be authenticated as a particular Account (e.g., account `default` by default).
this account that is associated with a pod is called a service-account.
`kubernetes.io/service-account-token` type of secret contains information about
kubernetes `service-account`. 

later in this book we'll need to create a pod with Juniper's proprietary CSRX
image, to do that we need to provide authentication information to kubernetes so
it can authenticate itself when pulling images during pod creation. therefore in
this section we'll focus on `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` type of secret.

////
* private registry (juniper hub) private repository in public docker registry
* (docker hub)
////

.methods to create a secret

just like many other kubernetes objects, there are many ways to create a secret.
in this section we'll demonstrate how to create a secret from:

* kubectl CLI with docker credential information
* kubectl CLI with docker credential file: `.docker/config.json`
* yaml file

////
* literal
* operator
* serviceAccount
////

=== create secret from CLI with docker credential data

to most straightforward method to create a `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`
type of secret is to provide login information directly to `kubectl` command and
let it to generate the secret:

----
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry secret-jnpr1 \
    --docker-server=hub.juniper.net                 \
    --docker-username=JNPR-FieldUser213             \
    --docker-password=CLJd2jpMsVc9zrAuTFPn
secret/secret-jnpr created
----

.verify the secret creation

----
$ kubectl get secrets
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
secret-jnpr           kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      6s   #<---
default-token-hkkzr   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      62d
----

please note that only the first line in the output is the secret we just
created. the second one is a `kubernetes.io/service-account-token` type of
secret that was created by kubernetes system automatically when the contrail
setup is up and running.

now inspect the details of the secret:

----
$ kubectl get secrets secret-jnpr -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: eyJhdXRocyI6eyJodWIuanVuaXBlci5uZXQvc2...<snipped>...
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2019-08-14T05:58:48Z
  name: secret-jnpr
  namespace: ns-user-1
  resourceVersion: "870370"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/ns-user-1/secrets/secret-jnpr
  uid: 9561cdc3-be58-11e9-9367-0050569e6cfc
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

not surprisingly, we don't see any sensitive information in the form of
cleartext, there is a `data` portion of the output where we see a very long
string as the value of key `.dockerconfigjson`. it seems to has a transformed
look from the original data, but at least it does not that "sensitive" anymore
now - overall one purpose of using secret is to improve the system security.

however, the transformation is done by "encoding", not "encryption", so there is
still a way to manually retrieve the original "sensitive" information back: just
pipe the value of key `.dockerconfigjson` into `base64` tool, the original
`username` and `password` information is printed again:

.decode the secret data

----
$ echo "eyJhdXRocyI6eyJodWIuanVua..." | base64 -d | python -mjson.tool
{
    "auths": {
        "hub.juniper.net": {
            "auth": "Sk5QUi1GaWVsZFVzZXIyMTM6Q0xKZDJqcE1zVmM5enJBdVRGUG4=",
            "password": "CLJd2jpMsVc9zrAuTFPn",
            "username": "JNPR-FieldUser213"
        }
    }
}
----

some highlights in the above output:

* `python -mjson.tool` is used to format the decoded json data before printing
  to the terminal.

* there is an `auth` key-value pair.  it is the token generated based on the
  authentication information you gave (`username` and `password`).

* later on when equiped with this secret, a pod will use this token, instead of
  the `username` and `password` to authenticate itself towards the private
  docker registry `hub.juniper.net` in order to pull an docker image

[TIP]
====
here is another way to decode the data directly from the secret object:

----
$ kubectl get secret secret-jnpr1 \
    --output="jsonpath={.data.\.dockerconfigjson}" \
    | base64 --decode | python -mjson.tool
{
    "auths": {
        "hub.juniper.net/security": {
            "auth": "Sk5QUi1GaWVsZFVzZXIyMTM6Q0xKZDJqcE1zVmM5enJBdVRGUG4=",
            "password": "CLJd2jpMsVc9zrAuTFPn",
            "username": "JNPR-FieldUser213"
        }
    }
}
----

the `--output=xxxx` option filters the `kubectl get` output so only value of
`.dockerconfigjson` under `data` is printed. the value is then piped into base64
with option `--decode` (alias of `-d`) to get it decoded. 
====

a `docker-registry` Secret created manually like this will only work with a
single private registry. to support multiple private container registries we
can create a secret from docker credential file.

=== create secret from CLI with docker credential file (`~/.docker/config.json`)

as the name of key `.dockerconfigjson` in the secret we created indicates, it
serves similar role as the docker config file: `.docker/config.json`. actually
you can generate the secret directly from the docker config file.

.generate docker credential info

first let's check the docker config file:

----
$ cat .docker/config.json
{
    ......
    "auths": {},
    ......
}
----

nothing really. depending on the usage of the setups you may see different
output here. but the point is that this docker config file will be updated
automatically each time when you `docker login` a new registry.

let's test it out.

----
$ cat mydockerpass.txt | \
    docker login hub.juniper.net \
        --username JNPR-FieldUser213 \
        --password-stdin
Login Succeeded
----

in file `mydockerpass.txt` is login password for my username
`JNPR-FieldUser213`. saving the password in a file and then piping it to the
`docker login` command with `--password-stdin` option has an advantage of not
exposing the password cleartext in the shell history. 

[TIP]
====
if you want you can give
the password directly, and you will get a friendly warn that this is "insecure".

----
$ docker login hub.juniper.net --username JNPR-FieldUser213 --password MYPASS
WARNING! Using --password via the CLI is insecure. Use --password-stdin.
Login Succeeded
----
====

now the docker credential info is generated in the updated config.json file:

----
$ cat .docker/config.json
{
    ......
    "auths": {    #<---
        "hub.juniper.net": {
            "auth": "Sk5QUi1GaWVsZFVzZXIyMTM6Q0xKZDJqcE1zVmM5enJBdVRGUG4="
        }
    },
    ......
}
----

The login process creates or updates a config.json file that holds an
authorization token.

.create secret from .docker/config.json file

----
$ kubectl create secret generic secret-jnpr2 \
    --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=/root/.docker/config.json \
    --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
secret/secret-jnpr2 created

$ kubectl get secrets
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE

        }
    },
    ......
}
----


=== create secret from yaml file

you can also create a secret directly from a yaml file, just the same way you
create other objects like service or Ingress.

manually encode the content of .docker/config.json file:

----
$ cat .docker/config.json | base64
ewoJImF1dGhzIjogewoJCSJodWIuanVuaXBlci5uZXQiOiB7CgkJCSJhdXRoIjogIlNrNVFVaTFH

KGxpbnV4KSIKCX0sCgkiZGV0YWNoS2V5cyI6ICJjdHJsLUAiCn0=
----

then put the base64 encoded value of .docker/config.json file as `data` in below
yaml file:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
metadata:
  name: secret-jnpr3
  namespace: ns-user-1
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: ewoJImF1dGhzIjogewoJCSJodW......
----

----
$ kubectl apply -f secret-jnpr.yaml
secret/secret-jnpr3 created

$ kubectl get secrets
NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-hkkzr   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      64d
secret-jnpr1          kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      9s
secret-jnpr2          kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      6m12s
secret-jnpr3          kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson        1      78s
----

////
stringData: not working yet
----

        auth: Sk5QUi1GaWVsZFVzZXIyMTM6Q0xKZDJqcE1zVmM5enJBdVRGUG4=
----
////

keep in mind that Base64 is all about "encoding" instead of "encryption",
it is considered the same as plain text. so sharing this file compromised
secret.

=== refer the secrets

after a secret is created, it can be referred by a pod/RC or deployment
in order to pull an image from the private registry.
there are many ways to refer the secrets. in this section we'll look at
using `imagePullSecrets` under pod `spec` to refer the secret.

////
* files 
* environment variable
* volumn
* imagePullSecrets
////

.`imagePullSecrets`

____
An `imagePullSecret` is a way to pass a secret that contains a Docker (or other)
image registry password to the Kubelet so it can pull a private image on behalf
of your Pod.
____

create a pod pulling Juniper CSRX container from private repository:

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: csrx-jnpr
  labels:
    app: csrx
  annotations:
   k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: '[
       { "name": "vn-left-1" },
       { "name": "vn-right-1" }
   ]'
spec:
  containers:
  #- name: csrx
  #  image: csrx
  - name: csrx
    image: hub.juniper.net/security/csrx:18.1R1.9
    ports:
    - containerPort: 22
    #imagePullPolicy: Never
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    stdin: true
    tty: true
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: secret-jnpr
----

generate the pod:

----
$ kubectl apply -f csrx/csrx-with-secret.yaml
pod/csrx-jnpr created
----

the csrx is up and running:

----
$ kubectl get pod
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
csrx-jnpr              1/1     Running   0          20h
----

behind the scene, the pod authenticates itself towards the private registry,
pulls the image, and launchs the CSRX container.

----
$ kubectl describe pod csrx
......
Events:
19h  Normal  Scheduled  Pod   Successfully assigned ns-user-1/csrx to cent333
19h  Normal  Pulling    Pod   pulling image "hub.juniper.net/security/csrx:18.1R1.9"
19h  Normal  Pulled     Pod   Successfully pulled image "hub.juniper.net/security/csrx:18.1R1.9"
19h  Normal  Created    Pod   Created container
19h  Normal  Started    Pod   Started container
----

=== secret benefit

as you can see from our test, the Secret objects is created independently of the
pods, and inspecting the object `spec` does not print the sensitive information
directly on the screen.

Secrets are not written to the disk, but instead it is stored in a `tmpfs` FS
only on nodes that need them. Also, Secrets are deleted when the pod that is
dependent on them is deleted.  

On most native Kubernetes distributions, communication between users and the
apiserver is protected by SSL/TLS. Therefore, Secrets transmitted over these
channels are properly protected.  

Any given pod does not have access to the Secrets used by another pod, which
facilitates encapsulation of sensitive data across different pods.  Each
container in a pod has to request a Secret volume in its volumeMounts  for it to
be visible inside the container. This feature can be used to construct security
partitions at the pod level.

== kubernetes networking

//TODO

== Network policy

In Kubernetes pods can reach any pods by default. Then how pods can be secured?
The answer is network policy. `Networkpolicy` is a Kubernetes resource like pod,
service, ingress and etc. It defines who are all can reach the pod(ingress) and
whom the pod can reach(egress). 

=== Prerequisites

Network polices are implemented by the network plugin, so you must be using a
network solution which supports Network Policy. Simply creating the resource
without a controller to implement it will have no effect.

Network policy logically can be divided into two sections. The first section
will identify the pod(s) where the Network policy would be applied. The second
section will define the ingress and egress rules for the selected pod(s). 

=== Pod(s) selection

How the pods would be selected? Yes. You are right. Pod(s) are identified using
labels.

    podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         role: db

In the above example the network policy would be applied to the pods which has
the label "role: db".

=== Ingress and egress rules for group of pod(s)

The second section defines the policy types for the selected pod(s). Policy type
can be `ingress` or `egress` or both. `Ingress` is the default policy type.
policy identifies the network endpoint where the selected pod(s) can
communicate. Network endpoint can be ip address block or pod(s) (all pods or
group of pods) in a namespace or selected pods in the same namespace.  Ingress
network-endpoint has to be defined in the "from" section. Egress
network-endpoint has to be defined in the "to" section. 

----
policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
        except:
        - 172.17.1.0/24
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: myproject
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
----
        
In the above example:

. The ingress network points are 
.. 172.17.0.0/16 and port except 172.17.1.0/24 
.. All the pods in namespaces which has the label “project: myproject”. 
.. Pods which has the label "role: frontend"

. The egress network points are 10.0.0.0/24

Is there any way to select few pods from namespaces instead of all pods in the
namespaces? Yes. It can be specified in the namespaceSelector.
`namespaceSelector` can have podSelector. When `namespaceSelector` has
`podSelector`, network endpoint would be pods with matching labels in the selected
namespaces.

The below example shows that allowing connections from pods with label
`role=client` in namespaces with the label `user=alice`. Please be aware to use
correct yaml syntax.

  ...
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          user: alice
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: client
  ...

So far it is fine. Still there is a security concern. Is there any way to
specify ports for ingress and egress? Yes. As part of the policy it can be
mentioned. If it is not mentioned it applies to all ports. Ports in ingress says
that selected pod(s) can allow traffic for the specified ports. Ports in egress
says that selected pod(s) can send traffic to specified ports.

Previous example along with port specifications

----
policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
        except:
        - 172.17.1.0/24
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          project: myproject
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 6379
  egress:
  - to:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5978
----

The above network policy says that all ingress network endpoint can reach
selected pod(s) tcp port 6379 and selected pod(s) can reach all egress network
endpoint's tcp port 5978.
The rest of the traffic would be blocked.

== livenessProbe and readinessProbe

=== Liveness Probe

What happen if the application in the POD is running but it can’t serve its main
purpose for whatever reason? also applications that runs for long time might
transition to broken states. In all cases the last thing you want have is a call
reporting a problem in an application that could be easily fixed with restarting
the POD. liveness probes is a Kubernetes features made specially for that.
liveness probes sent a pre-defined request to the POD on a regular basis then
restart the POD if this request failed. The most commonly used liveness probe is
HTTP GET request, but it could also be opening TCP socket or issuing a command


this is a HTTP GET request probe example where the “initialDelaySeconds” is the
waiting time before the first try to HTTP GET request to port 80 then it will
run the probe every 20 second as specified in “periodSeconds” If that failed the
POD would be restarted automatically. you have the option to specify the path
which in here just the main website. also you can send the probe with customized
header

request probes, but it will open TCP socket.

=== Readiness Probe

Liveness probe make sure that your POD is in good health, but for some
application Liveness alone isn’t enough. some application need to load large
files before it start. you might think if we set a higher “initialDelaySeconds”
value then problem solve. but this not an efficient way. Readiness probe is
solution in here specially with Kubernetes services, as the POD will not receive
a traffic until it report ready. Readiness Probe is configured the same way as
liveness prob 

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: liveness-readiness
  labels:
    app: tcpsocket-test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: liveness-readiness-pod
      image: virtualhops/ato-ubuntu:latest
      ports:
       - containerPort: 80
      securityContext:
          privileged: true
          capabilities:
           add:
             - NET_ADMIN
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
           path: /
           port: 80
           httpHeaders:
           - name: some-header
             value: Running
        initialDelaySeconds: 15
        periodSeconds: 20
      readinessProbe:
        tcpSocket:
          port: 80
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 10
----

NOTE: its recommended to use both Readiness Probe and Liveness Probe where
Liveness probe restart the POD if it failed and Readiness Probe make sure the
POD is ready before it gets the traffic 

Probes have a number of fields that you can use to more precisely control the
behavior of liveness and readiness checks.

1. `initialDelaySeconds`: Number of seconds after the container has started before
   liveness or readiness probes are initiated.
2. `periodSeconds`: How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10
   seconds. Minimum value is 1.
3. `timeoutSeconds`: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults
   to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.
4. `successThreshold`: Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be
   considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for
   liveness. Minimum value is 1.
5. `failureThreshold`: When a Pod starts and the probe fails, Kubernetes will try
   `failureThreshold` times before giving up.  Giving up in case of liveness probe
   means restarting the Pod. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked
   Unready.  Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.

HTTP probes have additional fields that can be set on httpGet.

1. host: Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to
   set “Host” in httpHeaders instead.
2. scheme: Scheme to use for connecting to the host (HTTP or HTTPS). Defaults to
   HTTP.
3. path: Path to access on the HTTP server.
4. httpHeaders: Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated
   headers.
5. port: Name or number of the port to access on the container. Number must be
   in the range 1 to 65535.

== Annotation 

We have seen before how labels in Kubernetes are used for identifying, selecting
and organizing objects, labels are just one way to attach metadata to Kubernetes
objects.

Another way is Annotations which is a key/value maps that attach non-identifying
metadata to objects, Annotation has a lot of use cases such as attaching

- pointers for logging and analytics
- phone number, directory entries and web site 
- timestamps, image hashes and registry address 
- network, namespaces
- type of ingress controller

example for annotations:
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: annotations-demo
  annotations:  #<--- 
    imageregistry: "https://hub.docker.com/"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.7.9
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
---

=== Annotations in Ingress

=== Annotations in Network Attachment Defination

Annotations can be used to assign network information to POD and we will
see later on in chapter 4 how Kubernetes annotation can instruct
contrail to attach an interface to certain network 

Before seeing Annotations in action lets first create a network with minimum
configuration based on the De-facto Kubernetes Network custom resource
definition.  Network Attachment Definition is used to indicate the CNI as well
the paraments of the network where we will attached interface POD to

----
apiVersion: "k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1"
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: net-a
spec:
  config: '{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.0",
    "type": "awesome-plugin"
  }'
----

The type in the example “awesome-plugin” is the name of the CNI which and could
be Flannel, Calico, Contrail-K8s-cni , …,etc 

Creating a POD and using annotations to attach its interface to a network called
net-a

----
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  namespace: my-namespace
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: net-a
----

Note: According to De-facto Kubernetes Network custom resource definition 
the annotation "k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks” is used to represent “
NetworkAttachmentDefinition” and has two format

----
Network  
   k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: net-a
----

----
Namespace/network name
   k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: ns/net-a
----

NOTE: To maintain compatibility with existing Kubernetes deployments, All pods
must still be attached to the cluster-wide default network. which means even if
we attached one POD interface to a specific network, this POD would have two
interfaces one attached to the cluster-wide default network and the other
interface is attached to the network specified in the annotation argument (net-a
in this case)
