== Day One: Building Containers Using Kubernetes and Contrail

This book details the long list of Juniper Contrail features that can
enrich Kubernetes implementatons. Startng with the basic concepts of containers
and moving through virtual networks and Contrail architecture, the authors
review the basic foundaton and key components of Kubernetes, including several
diferent Kubernetes features without Contrail integraton. But the core of the
book is devoted to detailed labs and use cases of Contrail and Kubernetes
together. Contrail can build and manage virtual networks that integrate
containers, VMs, and bare metal servers of all types, so the authors focus on
how to integrate a popular pair: Kubernetes and Contrail.

== Key Juniper Contrail Resources

The Juniper TechLibrary has been supporting Contrail with its excellent
documentation for years. The Contrail selection is thorough, and it’s kept
up-to-date with the latest technologies and GUI changes. This book is no
substitution for that body of information. The authors assume that you have
some familiarity with Juniper Contrail documentation:
https://www.juniper.net/documentation/product/en_US/contrail-networking/5.0

The authors keep a GitHub website at
https://github.com/pinggit/kubernetes-contrail-day-one , where you can find the
book’s content, all the YAML file source code used for the examples, figures,
etc. Add com- ments, suggestions or questions regarding the book, too.”

=== topics

* Container technology and different Kubernetes features using YAML.
* Kubernetes integration with Contrail.
* Kubernetes network policy and Contrail firewall security.
* Configuring isolated Kubernetes Namespaces using Contrail.
* Configuring Floating IP in Contrail to provide container’s outside connectivity.

=== chapters

This book details the long list of Juniper Contrail features that can enrich
Kubernetes implementations. It starts with the basics and builds from there to
cover more complex setups. It’s structured as follows:

* _Chapter 1:_ Provides a basic understanding of containers, virtual networks, and Contrail architecture.
* _Chapter 2:_ Lays down the basic foundation and key components of Kubernetes.
* _Chapter 3:_ Explains different Kubernetes features using labs and without any Contrail integration.
* _Chapters 4 through 10:_ These chapters are the core of the book. They begin
  by explaining Contrail inte- gration with Kubernetes, then continue on to
  cover a number of detailed labs and use cases using Con- trail/Kubernetes.

== Contrail Command

Contrail Command(CC) is the new user interface (UI) starting with Contrail
5.0.1. Throughout this book we use both the new CC and the old UI to
demonstrate the lab studies. The publication date for this book is November
2019, so depending on when you are reading it, keep in mind that CC will soon
be the only UI; the legacy one is slated to be discontinued at some time.
Detailed information about CC is available from the Juniper documentation
website, so we don’t elaborate on it here. To access CC use this URL in your
web browser: https://Contrail-Command-Server-IP-Address:9091. The CC server can
be the same as, or different from, the Kubernetes master server or the Contrail
Controller node. In this book, we’ve installed them in same server.  The
functions and settings in CC are grouped in a main menu. This makes a great
entry point where you can navigate through different Contrail functions. To get
the CC main menu, click on the group name right next to the Contrail Command
logo on the upper left corner of the UI.

Remember, our focus is not on CC but on giving you some basic insights into CC,
which will be helpful to you as you build containers using Kubernetes.

This book is free and is maintained as a "open source" project! you can find
all text, diagrams, source code it refers in this GitHub repository:

- README.adoc                 : this file
- kubernetes-contrail-v1.pdf  : version v1, this is the PFD available in all
  official channels. the TOC (Table of Content) has problems
- kubernetes-contrail-v1.1pdf : version v1.1, with corrections on TOC
- kubernetes-contrail-v1.mobi : for kindle 

- kubernetes-contrail.pdf     : original draft (before editor's editing), with original TOC
- kubernetes-contrail.html    : original draft in html format, with a
  TOC panel on the right side, making it the same looking and feeling as the
  PDF, but much smaller.
- kubernetes-contrail.mobi    : original draft in kindle format

- kubernetes-contrail.adoc    : "source code" of the original "draft" of the
  whole book, the format in which we've writen/maintained.

output, etc), documentation, or anything else, please don’t hesitate to submit

== known issues

=== diff between pdf version and adoc/html version

This book was originally written in adoc format, which is github version
control friendly. with this format it went through many changes via git
commit/PR flow during the writing process. However, some final modifications
(mostly minor though) between authors and reviewer/editors are through an
"offline" process (in MS-word and adobe-PDF format), and hence have not get
cought by the adoc source and github yet. In another word, those last changes
are in PDF format only (at of now) and has not been merged into adoc/html
format yet.

=== PDF book TOC problem

the TOC of original book PDF (Containers_Kubernetes_Contrail.pdf) has some
problem. 

for example chapter 6 cuently shows:

  |chapter 6: Contrail Ingress
  . |Contrail Ingress Workflow
  . |Contrail Ingress Traffic Flow

but it should look like:

  |chapter 6: Contrail Ingress
  . |Contrail Ingress Loadbalancer
  . |Contrail Ingress Workflow
  . |Contrail Ingress Traffic Flow
  . |Single Service Ingress
  . . |`Ingress` Objects Definition
  . . . |`Ingress` Definition
  . . . |Backend `service` Definition
  . . . |Backend `pod` Definition
  . . . |An "all in one" Yaml File
  . . . |Deploy the Single Service Ingress
  . . |`Ingress` Post Examination
  . . . |Ingress Object
  . . . |Service Objects
  . . . |Backend and Client Pod
  . . . |Haproxy Processes
  . . . |Ingress Loadbalancer Objects
  . . . |`haproxy.conf` File
  . . . |Gateway Router VRF Table
  . . . |`Ingress` Verification: Internal
  . . . |`Ingress` Verification: External (Internet host)
  . |Simple Fanout Ingress
  . . |`Ingress` Objects Definition
  . . . |`ingress` Definition
  . . . |backend `service` definition
  . . . |backend `pod` definition
  . . . |deploy `simple fanout Ingress`
  . . |`Ingress` post examination
  . . . |ingress objects and ingress loadbalancer
  . . . |haproxy process and haproxy.cfg file
  . . |`Ingress` verification: from internal
  . . |`Ingress` verification: from external (Internet host)
  . |Virtual Hosting Ingress
  . . |`Ingress` objects definition
  . . . |`ingress` definition
  . . . |an "all in one" yaml file
  . . |`Ingress` post examination
  . . . |examine ingress objects
  . . . |exploring Ingress loadbalancer objects
  . . . |examine `haproxy.conf` file
  . . |`Ingress` verification: from internal
  . . |`Ingress` verification: from external (Internet host)
  . |Service vs Ingress Traffic Flow

I may find some time to fix it and post a new one.
before that, if this is a problem for you, read these files:
